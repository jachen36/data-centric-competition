# Data-Centric Ai Competition

First ever type of data science competition where the only focus is on the data rather than data plus modeling. Overall the competition is similar to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) where teams are ranked based on how well the model perform on a private held out data set; however, the difference is that the model is held static and every team will need to be creative in how they clean, feature engineer, or augment the data inorder to improve the model performance. This is a new trend that Andrew Ng is starting because high-performance model architectures are widely available, while approaches to engineering datsets have lagged.

# Summary of My Approach

Due to the limited amount of time I had, I wasn't able to try much before it ended.

1. Consistent labeling by documenting a guide on how to label.
1. Augmentations to add variety to the training dataset and make model generalize better.
